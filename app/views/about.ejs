	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>I was inspired to start Victoria Blake Collection in 2012 based on a conversation that I had with a mentor of mine. He asked me what was the legacy that I was going to leave for my daughter. I knew that I wanted to instill in her a strong work ethic and a passion for learning, but the question he asked left an unsettling feeling in my stomach. Were these attributes that I was instilling in her enough for her to succeed on her own. I knew that I needed to create a company that would provide her with many opportunities to be creative, discover a new world and to shine in it. I also knew that for it to be successful it would have to be created now by me, while she was still young.</p>
	<p> I have always had a desire to work with materials that are a part of nature and I strongly wanted to be able to create a healthy environment with spiritually healthy people.  So it gave me great pleasure to create a company whose emphasis would be to re-design and co- create your jewelry, so that you can carry your memories with you or pass these treasures on to a loved one. I believe that this would be in harmony with sustainability that in turn would help our environment and create a positive global effect. </p>
	<p>The vision oVictoria Blake Collection is to provide the unique service of re-designing your antique or modern heirloom jewelry into multi generational keepsakes that transcends physical space, age and time using natural gemstones and sustainable materials.</p>
	<p>It is our mission to build a social media platform that broadens the education of consumers and direct retailers about sustainable materials. Â—It is  also our sincere desire to provide quality services for the customer so that every treasure big or small can be re-transformed into a lasting heirloom for generations to come.</p>
